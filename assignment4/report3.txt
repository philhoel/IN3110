"The advantage of the Numba package is that Numba compiles any python that
that it can directly to machine code and then stores it as machine code until
next time you run the function. The disadvantage of using Numba is that it uses
longer time than Numpy the first time and then it will be faster. Since we have
such short code, Numba won't pass Numpy unless we loop it a lot of times.
