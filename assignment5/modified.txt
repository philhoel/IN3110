A man goes to the doctor and says, "Doctor, wherever I touch, it hurt."
The doctor asks, "What do you mean by that?"
The man says, "When I touch my shoulder, it really hurts. If I touch my knee - OUCH! When I touch my forehead, it really, really hurts."
The doctor says, "I know what's wrong with you. You've broken your finger!"
